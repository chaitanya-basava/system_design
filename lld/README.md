# Design Patterns

In this, we discuss and implement examples for various design patterns in LLD.

Broadly, design patterns can be categorized into three types:
1. Creational design patterns
2. Behavioural design patterns
3. Structural design patterns

Each of the categories has multiple different patterns, the important one 
from the bunch would be covered in this repo.

### Creational design patterns
Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
It is responsible for creating objects (or) controlling the object creation process.

- [X] [Abstract Factory Method Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/creational/abstract_factory_pattern)
- [X] [Singleton Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/creational/singleton_pattern)
- [X] [Prototype Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/creational/prototype_pattern)
- [X] [Builder Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/creational/builder_pattern)
- [X] [Object Pool Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/creational/object_pool_pattern)

### Behavioral design patterns
take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

- [X] [Strategy Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/strategy_pattern)
- [X] [NULL Object Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/null_object_pattern)
- [X] [Command Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/command_pattern)
- [X] [Iterator Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/iterator_pattern)
- [X] [Template Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/template_method_pattern)
- [X] [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/chain_of_responsibility)
- [X] [Mediator Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/mediator_pattern)
- [X] [Interpreter Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/interpreter_pattern)
- [X] [Observer Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/behavioral/observer_pattern)
- [ ] State Pattern
- [ ] Memento Pattern

### Structural design patterns
explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient

- [X] [Decorator Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/structural/decorator_pattern)
- [X] [Adapter Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/structural/adapter_pattern)
- [ ] Bridge Pattern
- [X] [Composite Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/structural/composite_pattern)
- [ ] [Facade Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/structural/facade_pattern)
- [X] [Flyweight Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/structural/flyweight_pattern)
- [X] [proxy Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/structural/proxy_pattern)
